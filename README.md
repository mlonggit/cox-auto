Code Exercise 1
 
Write a function that determines if a given string is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha". 
For this question, ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper- and lower-case characters are identical.

Code Exercise 2:
 
Write a function that sums up keys in a text file.
The file contains data in the format of key, count where key is a string and count is an integer. 
Each line will only contain one key-count pair. 
The output should be each key which occurred in the file, along with the total of all occurrences for a given key.
